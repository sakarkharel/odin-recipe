    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Caprese salad</strong> is a classic <em>Italian</em> dish renowned for its simplicity and fresh flavors. It features a combination of ripe tomatoes, 
        creamy mozzarella cheese, fragrant basil leaves,<br> and a drizzle of high-quality extra virgin olive oil. The salad is typically assembled 
        by layering slices of tomatoes and mozzarella cheese alternately on a plate, with basil leaves interspersed<br> between them. The vibrant colors of 
        red, white, and green pay homage to the Italian flag, making this salad not only delicious but visually appealing as well. The creamy texture of 
        the mozzarella<br> complements the juicy sweetness of the tomatoes, while the basil adds a refreshing herbal note. A generous drizzle of extra virgin 
        olive oil enhances the flavors and adds richness to the dish.<br> Some variations may include a splash of balsamic vinegar for a tangy contrast or a sprinkle 
        of salt and pepper for added seasoning. Caprese salad is a perfect representation of Italian cuisine's<br> emphasis on using fresh, high-quality ingredients to 
        create dishes that are both simple and satisfying. It's a delightful appetizer or side dish that captures the essence of summer with every bite.</p>
