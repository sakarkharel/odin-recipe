    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> <strong>Momo</strong>, a beloved dish originating from <em>Nepal</em> and popular across South Asia, is a delectable dumpling delicacy that 
        tantalizes taste buds with its savory filling and delicate wrapper.<br> To prepare this culinary delight, begin by crafting a flavorful 
        mixture of finely minced meat, often chicken, lamb, or pork, combined with aromatic spices such as garlic, ginger, and coriander. <br>
        This seasoned filling is then carefully encased in thin rounds of dough, made from flour and water, which are folded into intricate 
        shapes resembling tiny purses. These little parcels are then<br> steamed to perfection, resulting in tender, juicy momos bursting with rich flavors. 
        Typically served with a dipping sauce made from tomatoes, chili, and a dash of tangy lemon, momos<br> offer a delightful fusion of textures and 
        tastes, making them a cherished favorite among food enthusiasts worldwide. Whether enjoyed as a comforting snack or a satisfying meal,<br>
        momos never fail to deliver a mouthwatering culinary experience that leaves diners craving for more.

                <li>Chop onions, garlic, ginger, green onions, and cilantro finely.</li>

                <li>Gradually add water and knead until a smooth, elastic dough forms.</li>
